# II1305-group6
Project course in IT, destination "passing grade"

Group 6, *the best group*, here tries to gather their data on git, -without messing up- (git was clean for 2 days).

As we learn what's needed, files will come 'n go.
For a more detailed journey plan, see the wiki where we post updates on the project under the [wiki/Blog](Blog) sektion.
